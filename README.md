Fuse-Filesystem
A custom FUSE-based filesystem implemented in C++ using standard C libraries. This project demonstrates low-level file operations by reading from WAD archive files, utilizing custom-built data structures, and mounting the filesystem on Linux.

Features
ðŸ“¦ WAD File Parsing: Reads and interprets WAD archive files (commonly used in games like Doom).

ðŸ§  Custom Data Structures: Efficient in-memory representations of file metadata and directory trees.

ðŸ”§ FUSE Integration: Mount the archive contents as a virtual filesystem on Linux.

ðŸ“‚ File and Directory Operations: Supports file reading, directory listing, and stat operations.

Technologies Used
